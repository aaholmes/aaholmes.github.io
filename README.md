I'm a researcher (Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, Cornell) focused on a unifying scientific challenge: **understanding and modeling the emergent phenomena that arise from complex, interacting systems.**

My work applies a unified toolkit to navigate the vast, intractable search spaces inherent in these domains‚Äîfrom the quantum many-body problem to multi-agent artificial intelligence. I design and apply principled algorithms from three core areas:

1.  **Heuristic Search:** Creating informed strategies to prune immense state spaces, like the **Hilbert space of many-body quantum states** or the game tree of chess.
2.  **Stochastic Methods:** Using Monte Carlo techniques to manage uncertainty and model high-dimensional systems.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning:** Applying modern deep learning to discover effective policies from data.

My current research applies this perspective to fundamental problems in **Robotics** and **AI**.

### üöÄ Featured Projects

I believe in choosing the right tool for the job. Many of these projects follow a hybrid model: the core, performance-critical algorithms are implemented in **Rust ü¶Ä**, with a high-level **Python üêç** layer for simulation, visualization, and rapid prototyping.

### üî¨ Foundational Research: RISQ

My Ph.D. work culminated in the **Rust Implementation of Semistochastic Quantum chemistry (RISQ)** package. This research introduced a new class of low-variance Monte Carlo methods that use a physically-motivated heuristic search to enable high-accuracy calculations on previously intractable quantum systems.
