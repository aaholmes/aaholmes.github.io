I'm a researcher (Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, Cornell) interested in understanding and modeling the **emergent phenomena that arise from complex, interacting systems.**

To navigate the vast search spaces inherent in these problems - from quantum many-body physics to multi-agent AI - my core approach is to design and build **hybrid systems** that combine the strengths of different computational paradigms. This philosophy appears throughout my work:

* **Algorithmically:** I design systems that fuse different modes of computation to achieve superior performance. These include:
  * **Semistochastic** methods that combine deterministic calculations with Monte Carlo sampling to reduce variance
  * **Hierarchical Search** algorithms (like in my chess engine) that blend classical alpha-beta search with Neural Network-based Monte Carlo Tree Search

* **Architecturally:** I build these systems using the best tools for the job, implementing performance-critical algorithms in **Rust ü¶Ä** and wrapping them in high-level **Python üêç** for simulation, analysis, and rapid development.

My current research applies this perspective to fundamental problems in **Robotics** and **AI**.

### üî¨ Foundational Research: RISQ

My Ph.D. research introduced a new family of quantum chemistry methods - **Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (HCI)** and its successor, **Semistochastic HCI (SHCI)** - that significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in high-accuracy electronic structure calculations. ¬† 

The core innovation was a paradigm shift in algorithm design. We replaced the inefficient "generate-then-test" approach of previous methods with a highly efficient "generate-only-the-important" strategy. This was accomplished with a novel deterministic heat-bath sampling algorithm that uses pre-sorted data to rapidly identify the most significant components of the quantum wavefunction, avoiding wasted computation on unimportant parts of the vast search space. ¬† 

This breakthrough enabled calculations on a scale previously considered intractable. A key benchmark was solving the electronic structure of the chromium dimer ($`\text{Cr}_2`$), a notoriously difficult problem with a search space of $`2 \times 10^{22}`$ configurations. HCI achieved near-exact results in minutes on a single CPU core, matching the accuracy of the best competing methods like the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). ¬† 

The subsequent development of Semistochastic HCI (SHCI) solved the primary memory bottleneck of the original method, making it a practical and powerful tool for the broader community. Today, HCI/SHCI is recognized as a benchmark method in its own right and has been implemented in or interfaced with major quantum chemistry packages, including PySCF (via the Dice and Arrow codes) and Q-Chem. The core algorithmic ideas have also proven to be highly versatile, forming the basis for new methods in areas like large active-space calculations (HCISCF) and computational vibrational spectroscopy (VHCI).
