I am a computational physicist (Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, Cornell) focused on developing and applying novel, high-performance algorithms to solve the **quantum many-body problem**.

My research centers on designing methods that can achieve near-exact accuracy for complex electronic structure problems, allowing for benchmark calculations on systems previously considered intractable. This work led to the development of **Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI)**, which has become recognized as a state-of-the-art tool for high-accuracy quantum chemistry.

The core philosophy behind my work is building **hybrid computational systems**‚Äîcombining deterministic algorithms with stochastic sampling, and high-performance **Rust ü¶Ä** or **C++** with high-level **Python üêç**‚Äîto navigate vast search spaces efficiently. I am now applying this foundational expertise in algorithm design to emerging challenges at the intersection of high-performance computing and **Artificial Intelligence**.

### **Foundational Research & Impact: High-Accuracy Quantum Chemistry**

My Ph.D. research introduced a new family of quantum chemistry methods‚Äî**Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (HCI)** ([Holmes, et al., *JCTC 2016*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07453)) and its successor, **Semistochastic HCI (SHCI)** ([Sharma, Holmes, et al., *JCTC 2017*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06660))‚Äîthat significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in high-accuracy electronic structure calculations. The core innovation was a paradigm shift in algorithm design, replacing inefficient "generate-and-test" approaches with a highly efficient strategy that deterministically identifies the most significant components of the quantum wavefunction.

These new methods enabled calculations on a scale previously considered intractable, allowing us to produce the first near-exact potential energy surfaces for fourteen low-lying electronic states of the **carbon dimer** ([Holmes, et al., *JCTC 2017*](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/147/16/164111/76673)), a key benchmark system for multireference quantum chemistry, and the ground state binding curve of the **chromium dimer** ([Li, Yao, Holmes, et al., *Phys. Rev. Res. 2020*](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.012015)), a grand-challenge problem that had remained outstanding for decades, effectively "closing a chapter in quantum chemistry." Today, SHCI is recognized as a leading benchmark method and has been implemented in or interfaced with major quantum chemistry packages.
