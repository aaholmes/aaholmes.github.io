I'm a researcher (Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, Cornell) focused on a unifying scientific challenge: **understanding and modeling the emergent phenomena that arise from complex, interacting systems.**

My work explores how simple, local rules give rise to complex global behavior in two key domains:
1.  **Quantum Physics:** Where the interactions of many electrons produce the emergent properties of molecules and materials.
2.  **Artificial Intelligence:** Where the interactions of many autonomous agents or learning parameters produce emergent intelligence and coordinated action.

To navigate the vast, intractable search spaces inherent in these problems, my primary tool is **heuristic search**. I design and apply principled, informed algorithms to find optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently, whether in the Hilbert space of a molecule or the decision space of a multi-robot team.

My current research applies this perspective to **Robotics** and **Fundamental AI**, with a focus on:
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Designing local agent rules that produce robust, emergent global intelligence.
- **Decision-Making & Game AI:** Creating hybrid systems that combine exact tactical search with learned strategic heuristics.
- **AI & Complex Systems:** Exploring the conceptual parallels between statistical mechanics and large-scale AI models.

### üî¨ Foundational Research: RISQ

My Ph.D. work culminated in the **Rust Implementation of Semistochastic Quantum chemistry (RISQ)** package. This research introduced a new class of low-variance Monte Carlo methods that use a physically-motivated heuristic search to enable high-accuracy calculations on previously intractable quantum systems.
