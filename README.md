I'm a researcher (Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, Cornell) interested in understanding and modeling the **emergent phenomena that arise from complex, interacting systems.**

To navigate the vast search spaces inherent in these problems - from quantum many-body physics to multi-agent AI - my core approach is to design and build **hybrid systems** that combine the strengths of different computational paradigms. This philosophy appears throughout my work:

* **Algorithmically:** I design systems that fuse different modes of computation to achieve superior performance. These include:
  * **Semistochastic** methods that combine deterministic calculations with Monte Carlo sampling to reduce variance
  * **Hierarchical Search** algorithms (like in my chess engine) that blend classical alpha-beta search with Neural Network-based Monte Carlo Tree Search

* **Architecturally:** I build these systems using the best tools for the job, implementing performance-critical algorithms in **Rust ü¶Ä** and wrapping them in high-level **Python üêç** for simulation, analysis, and rapid development.

My current research applies this perspective to fundamental problems in **Robotics** and **AI**.

### üî¨ Foundational Research: RISQ

My Ph.D. work culminated in the **Rust Implementation of Semistochastic Quantum chemistry (RISQ)** package. This research introduced a new class of low-variance Monte Carlo methods that use a physically-motivated heuristic search to enable high-accuracy calculations on previously intractable quantum systems.
